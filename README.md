## Getting Started  
  
These instructions are for the development and use of the SingularityNET CLI.
For further details, please check our full [Documentation](http://snet-cli-docs.singularitynet.io/).

### Installing with pip

#### Install prerequisites

You should have python with version >= 3.6.5 and pip installed.

Additionally you should install the following packages:

* libudev
* libusb 1.0

If you use Ubuntu (or any Linux distribution with APT package support) you should do the following:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

#### Install snet-cli using pip

```bash
$ pip3 install snet-cli
```


#### Enabling commands autocomplete
If you want to enable auto completion of commands, you should install the following package
* python-argcomplete

On ubuntu (or any Linux distribution with APT package support), you should do the following

```bash
sudo apt install python-argcomplete
```
After the package is installed, activate autocomplete 

##### for all python commands (which includes snet commands as well) 

```bash
sudo activate-global-python-argcomplete
```
Note: Changes will not take effect until shell is restarted.

##### only for snet commands, then you should do the following
```bash
echo 'eval "$(register-python-argcomplete snet)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```
then
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
