SingularityNET CLI
  
## Getting Started  
  
These instructions are intended to facilitate the development and use of the SingularityNET CLI.

### Installing with pip

#### Install prerequisites

You should have python with version >= 3.6.5 and pip installed.

Additionally you should install the following packages:

* libudev
* libusb 1.0

If you use Ubuntu (or any Linux distribution with APT package support) you should do the following:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

#### Install snet-cli using pip

```bash
$ pip3 install snet-cli
```
